# Adaptive Stock Trading Bot ðŸ§ ðŸ“ˆ  

A hybrid **stock trading bot** that combines **deep forecasting (GRU)** with **Reinforcement Learning (PPO)** to adaptively learn profitable trading strategies.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Deep Forecasting (GRU):** Predicts future stock prices based on historical trends.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (PPO):** Learns optimal trading actions (buy/sell/hold) through trial and error.  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines time-series forecasting with policy optimization for better performance.  
- **Simulation Environment:** Custom Gym environment for realistic stock trading simulation.  
- **Performance:** Achieved **18.6% simulated returns** with **24% faster convergence** compared to baseline models.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- **PyTorch** (GRU, PPO implementation)  
- **Stable Baselines3** (RL algorithms)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualizations)  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- **Simulated Return:** 18.6%  
- **Training Convergence:** 24% faster  
- **Forecasting Accuracy:** GRU outperformed baseline LSTMs
